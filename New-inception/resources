if [ ! -f /var/www/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php ] ; then 

The line of code you provided is a conditional statement that checks if a file with the name /var/www/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php does not exist. If the file does not exist, the commands following the then keyword will be executed.

Here is what the code does:

[ and ] are shell builtins that allow you to run test commands.

! is a logical negation operator that reverses the meaning of the test command.

-f is a test option that checks if the specified file exists and is a regular file (not a directory or a symbolic link, for example).

/var/www/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php is the path to the file being tested.

So, the code checks if the file /var/www/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php does not exist (! -f), and if this is the case, the commands following the then keyword will be executed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
